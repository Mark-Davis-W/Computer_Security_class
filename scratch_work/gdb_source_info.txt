run gdb like normal

before running the program:

type: source ./<(path)/filename> 
   --gdb looks in directory it was started in so if a
   --fle is in another level you have to provide path
   --for each time

enjoy a premade breakpoint/print/etc set file

run program and watch it work as you debug
