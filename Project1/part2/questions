1. What is the population variance of the relative letter frequencies in English text?

2. What is the population variance of the relative letter frequencies in the given plaintext?

3. For each of the following keys — yz, xyz, wxyz, vwxyz, uvwxyz — encrypt the plaintext with
a Vigenère cipher and the given key, then calculate the population variance of the relative
letter frequencies in the resulting ciphertext.

4. Viewing a Vigenère key of length k as a collection of k independent Caesar ciphers, calculate
the mean of the frequency variances of the ciphertext for each one. (E.g., for key yz, calculate
the frequency variance of the even numbered ciphertext characters and the frequency variance
of the odd numbered ciphertext characters. Then take their mean.)

5. Consider the ciphertext that was produced with key uvwxyz. Let’s assume you are trying to
figure out the length of the key used to encrypt that ciphertext. Calculate the mean of the
frequency variances that arise if you assume that the key had length 2, 3, 4, and 5 (using the
same technique you did in part (4)). How can this help you determine the length of the key?
